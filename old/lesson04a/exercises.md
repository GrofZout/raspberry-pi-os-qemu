## Exercises


1. Modify the kernel to add an idle task. What should be executed in the body of the idle task? 
1. Add WAIT state to tasks. How are we going to bookkeep tasks in WAIT state? How do you demonstrate that your implementation is correct? 
1. (optional) Modify the kernel: allow it to have an unlimited number of tasks (right now the limit is 64).
