## Exercises

1. Change the reset value of TVAL so that the timer fires roughly every 1 sec. 

2. How can you determine such a value and show your solution is correct? 

3. Trigger an exception at EL1, handle it at EL2, and return to EL1. Modify the kernel source to implement the behavior. 

4. In a paragraph, describe the exception you plan to trigger, what EL2 exception handlers you will implement, and how to demonstrate your implementation correctness.
